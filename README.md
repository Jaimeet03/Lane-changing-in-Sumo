Designed and developed a simulation-based decision-making model for autonomous vehicles using SUMO, Python (TraCI API), and robust software engineering principles. The project focuses on complex urban traffic navigation with a structured development process that includes rigorous testing and design methodologies.

Key Highlights:

ðŸ”¹ Integrated a stacked BiLSTM with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG & Inverse Q-Learning).

ðŸ”¹ Modeled adaptive, real-time lane change and speed control behaviors.

ðŸ”¹ Leveraged SUMO traffic simulations for realistic urban driving scenarios.

ðŸ”¹ Applied best practices in software design and testing for reliability.
